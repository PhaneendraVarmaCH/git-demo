I’ve been in my mind
It’s such a fine line
That keeps me searchin’ for a heart of gold
And I’m gettin’ old

<<<<<<< HEAD


Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

And I miss you when you’re not around
I’m getting ready to leave the ground

=======
And I miss you when you’re not around
I’m getting ready to leave the ground
